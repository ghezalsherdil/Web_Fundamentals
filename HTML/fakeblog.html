      <p>This summer I look a 3 week long vacation. I traveled a few countries in Europe.
      It was one of the most amazing trips Iâ€™ve taken. It was nice getting to see other cultures
      and how they do things. I realized that not everything is at your finger tips when you want
      like it is in America, we are definitely spoiled here. One of my favorite places was
      Santorini, Greece. It was breathtakingly beautiful. My favorite city was Prague.
      The architecture was phenomenal. Will definitely go back to other countries in Europe next year.</p>
